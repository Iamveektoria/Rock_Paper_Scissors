# Rock, Scissors, Paper Game

Welcome to Rock, Scissors, Paper Game â€“ **a classic game known worldwide!** This timeless game, also known as jian dao, shi tou, bu in China, pierre-papier-ciseaux in France, roshambo in parts of the U.S., taÅŸ kaÄŸÄ±t makas in Turkey, and jan-ken-pon in Japan, has entertained people for centuries. Initially played during the Han Dynasty in ancient China, it's a playful way of settling disputes and making decisions, whether in schoolyards or barrooms.

## How to Play

In this game, two players compete. Each player secretly selects one of three moves: rock, paper, or scissors. When both players reveal their moves simultaneously, rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper. If both players pick the same move, it's a draw. The game can be played as a single round or extended to a "best of three" series or any number of rounds you prefer.

## Object-Oriented Design

This Python implementation uses object-oriented programming. The main class, Player, has four subclasses, one of which represents the human player. You can choose to play against one of three distinct computer players, each with unique strategies, or you can watch two computer players battle it out.

## Features

1. User-Friendly Interface: The game ensures valid human player input and handles errors gracefully without crashing.
2. Flexible Gameplay: Players can choose to play a single round, play a "best of three" series, or quit the game at any time.
3. Scorekeeping: After each round, the program displays the players' scores and continues the game for the remaining rounds. The final winner is announced at the end.

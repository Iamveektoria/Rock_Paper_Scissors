This is a simple game called Rock, Scissors or Paper!

The game of Rock Paper Scissors is played throughout the world. It dates back to the Han Dynasty of ancient China, contemporary with the Roman Empire. Today it is called jian dao, shi tou, bu in China, pierre-papier-ciseaux or chifoumi in France; roshambo in parts of the U.S., taş kağıt makas in Turkey, and jan-ken-pon in Japan. It is the distant ancestor of the type system in the immensely popular Pokémon games. The game is played competitively; there have been international RPS tournaments — however, it's more commonly used as a playful way of settling disputes, whether in the schoolyard or the barroom.

The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" — rock, paper, or scissors. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper. Players can play a single round, or "best of three", or any number of other options.

This program uses object oriented programming. It has four subclasses of the main class - Player, of which one is the human player! This means you can either play with one of the 3 different created player whcih ofcourse plays differently or you can watch two players play!

The code ensures the humanplayer input is always valid and catches any error without crashing. It gives the human player the option of playing once, thrice or quitting during the game play. After every round of play, the program announces the players score and continues for the remaining rounds accumulatively before printed out who won over all!

This code is in line the Python pycodestyle standards!
